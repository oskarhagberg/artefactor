// author's blob so the host can re-seed the served artefact read-only.

// may view the artefact (AD4) may load **any** author's entry. Crucially these
// are NOT auth-gated by the caller's identity — an unauthenticated viewer of a
// `public` artefact may read others' entries (they simply cannot write, AD5).
// Missing / archived / not-viewable artefact → not-found, exactly like own-data.

// List the authors who have a data entry for the referenced artefact.

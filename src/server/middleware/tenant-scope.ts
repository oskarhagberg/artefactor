// composition root supplies a resolver, the shared route handlers call it, and a
// superset overrides *which* tenant a request sees **without editing core**.
//
// OSS wires `singletonScopeResolver` — every request maps to `DEFAULT_TENANT`, so
// the scope filter is a no-op and behaviour is byte-identical. A multi-tenant
// superset injects a resolver that reads the caller's **active org** from the
// session (ET2), which also drives the Postgres RLS `SET LOCAL app.tenant_id`
// backstop (EP2).

// S18 — surface the authoring skill through the MCP connector. Claude design (and
// any MCP client) can use the connector but CANNOT load the `artefactor` Agent
// Skill, so the persistence-authoring contract — which must be known *before* the
// HTML is written — has to reach the model another way. Two ambient channels:
//
//   1. The server's `instructions` (returned in `initialize`, injected into the
//      model's context the moment the connector is enabled) carry the compact
//      contract below — present before any tool is called, i.e. before authoring.
//   2. The `get_authoring_guide` tool returns the FULL skill body on demand
//      (template, checklist, breaking-change guidance).
//
// SKILL.md (`skills/artefactor/SKILL.md`) is the single source for (2); the short
// summary in (1) is the one hand-authored copy and MUST stay faithful to it. Keep
// all three (skill ↔ instructions ↔ tool surface) in sync — same no-drift rule as
// the specs (see CLAUDE.md).

// The compact, always-present persistence contract. A faithful condensation of
// the "Persisting data" section of SKILL.md — keep it in step with that file.
export const PERSISTENCE_CONTRACT_SUMMARY = `Artefactor hosts self-contained HTML artefacts and gives them server-side persistence for free by hijacking localStorage: when an artefact is served, window.localStorage is replaced with a shim backed by a per-user store on the server. From the artefact's point of view there is exactly one set of data — the same mental model as plain localStorage.

When you AUTHOR an artefact's HTML, follow this persistence contract so saved data survives:

1. Persist ONLY through the standard localStorage API. Not IndexedDB, cookies, sessionStorage, or your own fetch/network code — only localStorage is backed by Artefactor's store. (sessionStorage looks similar but is NOT persisted.)
2. Keep your whole state as ONE JSON object under ONE versioned key (e.g. "my-artefact-v1"). Versioning the key lets you migrate later: bump it and old data is ignored.
3. Wrap every getItem/setItem in try/catch and degrade to in-memory. A write can fail and must never break the artefact: the data may be loaded read-only (writes rejected), over the 5 MB budget (QuotaExceededError), or unavailable (opened as a bare file). You never detect or control read-only mode yourself — just tolerate a failed write.
4. Stay under 5 MB total. Don't stuff big base64 images/files into saved state — keep them in the HTML or reference them by URL.
5. Debounce frequent writes (~400 ms, e.g. typing in a textarea). Don't depend on storage events or cross-tab sync.

Reads are synchronous and instant (the server seeds saved data before your script runs, so getItem returns the saved value on first paint). Writes save automatically (debounced, flushed when the page is hidden/closed). Opened as a plain file, native localStorage is used — same code still works.

Publishing: use create_artefact to publish, update_artefact to iterate in place (HTML is a full replacement, not a patch), set_visibility to share. Before a breaking data-shape change to an artefact that already has saved data (get_artefact / update_artefact report dataAuthorCount), bump the storage-key version or publish a new artefact — never silently change the shape in place.

Call get_authoring_guide for the full contract, a ready-to-use template, and the shipping checklist.`;

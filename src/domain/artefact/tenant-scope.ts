// `ArtefactRepository` read never returns a row whose `tenantId` differs from
// the scope's, and subordinate data/view/version reads inherit it (T2).
//
// OSS is single-tenant *by being one deployment*, so every query uses the
// `SINGLETON_SCOPE` and the filter is a no-op (all rows carry `DEFAULT_TENANT`)
// — behaviour is byte-identical. A multi-tenant superset resolves the scope from
// the caller's **active org** per request (ET2), which also maps 1:1 onto the
// Postgres RLS `SET LOCAL app.tenant_id` backstop (EP2). It is deliberately a
// *single* tenant, not a set: a user who belongs to many orgs operates within
// one active org per request, and switching orgs re-scopes every query.
//
// `findBySlug` is intentionally **not** scope-aware: a slug is a globally-unique
// capability (AH6) — the cross-tenant address used by public/link serving and
// the mint-time uniqueness check — and the per-tier tenant decision for a
// slug-served artefact belongs to the `AccessPolicy` seam (S22 part B / ET3),
// not to the repository scope.

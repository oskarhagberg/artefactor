# Bounded Context: Identity & Access

Authentication and machine credentials. **Largely delegated to [BetterAuth](https://www.better-auth.com/).**
Artefactor does not hand-roll user/session/password handling.

## Delegation boundary

- **BetterAuth owns:** user records, sessions, social-provider (OAuth) linkage, and the
  login/logout flow. It persists its own tables via the **Drizzle adapter** on the shared
  SQLite database.
- **The domain owns:** the *meaning* of an account as an artefact **Owner**. The domain
  refers to a user only by their stable BetterAuth **user id** (`ownerId`). It does not
  duplicate profile/auth data.

This keeps Identity thin: there is no rich `Account` aggregate to invariant-check beyond
"this user id exists and the request is authenticated as them."

## Authentication

Two methods, both via BetterAuth, gated by environment:

1. **Google OAuth** (BetterAuth social sign-in) — the **production** method. Google verifies
   the email; the domain allowlist (below) then gates who may have an account.
2. **Email + password** (BetterAuth credential provider) — enabled **only outside
   production**, for zero-config local dev and the test suite. It is **disabled in
   production** (`emailAndPassword.enabled = NODE_ENV !== "production"`), so the open,
   unverified sign-up path cannot exist in prod.

Both are additive and can link to the same user. Sessions are issued and validated by
BetterAuth and surfaced to the Hono BFF as the current authenticated user. Every BFF endpoint
that mutates or reads non-public artefacts (or writes data) requires an authenticated session
and authorizes against `ownerId` / the access matrix.

### Sign-up allowlist (email domain)

Account **creation** is restricted to a configured set of email domains
(`AUTH_ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS`, default `humly.io,humly.co.uk`). The check is a pure predicate
(`domain/identity/email-domain.ts`) enforced in BetterAuth's `databaseHooks.user.create.before`
hook — so it applies on the *create* path for **every provider** (Google and dev email+pw). A
disallowed domain can never create an account, and therefore can never sign in. Matching is
exact and case-insensitive (a subdomain like `x@sub.humly.io` is **not** a match for
`humly.io`). Google's single-domain `hd` option is deliberately not used, since two domains
are allowed.

## API keys (programmatic push)

Use **BetterAuth's API-key plugin** rather than a custom credential aggregate.

- An API key belongs to exactly one Account (user id).
- A key authenticates **API push** ingestion as its owning Account — artefacts created via
  API push are owned by that Account, with identical invariants to UI uploads.
- Keys can be **issued** and **revoked**. A revoked key cannot authenticate.
- Key secrets are stored hashed (handled by the plugin); the plaintext is shown once at
  issuance.

## Invariants

1. A private artefact is readable/mutable only by a request authenticated as its `ownerId`.
2. An API key maps to exactly one Account; ingestion via that key is attributed to it.
3. A revoked key authenticates nothing.
4. An Account may be created only with an email whose domain is in the configured
   allowlist; this holds for every authentication provider.

## Open questions

- API keys: scopes/expiry beyond issue/revoke. Default: **no** scopes, revisit if needed.
- OAuth providers beyond Google (e.g. GitHub). Default: Google only at launch.

# Bounded Context: Artefact Data (backend store)

A simple per-artefact, per-user JSON store. It lets form / interactive artefacts persist
data **server-side** instead of (or alongside) browser `localStorage`. The motivating
example is an artefact that today does `localStorage.setItem(KEY, JSON.stringify({...}))`;
the backend store is a drop-in replacement that survives across browsers.

**The blob is opaque to the backend.** Each artefact decides the shape of its own payload —
the `{cards, sections}` object in the reference artefact is just one example. The store
validates that the body is *valid JSON within the size cap* and nothing more; it never
interprets or schema-checks the contents.

**The artefact sees exactly one dataset.** From inside the served artefact there is a single
set of data — the same mental model as plain `localStorage`. The artefact never reads across
users and never knows whose data it holds. Choosing *which* user's data is loaded is a
**host concern** handled by Artefactor's own UI *outside* the artefact container (see *Data
context*), and is opaque to the artefact.

## Aggregate: `DataEntry`

One entry per **(artefact, author)** pair. The whole stored object is a single opaque JSON
blob, mirroring how artefacts already keep one JSON object under one storage key.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `id` | DataEntryId (uuid) | Identity. |
| `artefactId` | ArtefactId | The artefact this data belongs to. Immutable. |
| `authorId` | UserId | The Account that wrote it. Immutable. |
| `blob` | JSON | Opaque JSON value, shape owned by the artefact. ≤ `MAX_BLOB_BYTES` (= **5 MB**). |
| `createdAt` | timestamp | First write. |
| `updatedAt` | timestamp | Last write (upsert bumps it). |

## Invariants

1. **One per pair**: at most one `DataEntry` per `(artefactId, authorId)`. Writes **upsert**.
2. **Author = writer**: `authorId` is the authenticated user performing the write. A user
   may write **only their own** entry — never another user's.
3. **Writes require auth — no anonymous writes**: every write is attributed to an
   authenticated `authorId`. Unauthenticated viewers of a `public` artefact can *read*
   entries but can never create or modify one. (Decided: anonymous writes are not allowed.)
4. **Read follows artefact access**: which entries a viewer may *load* (through the host
   data-context switcher) is governed by the `Artefact` access matrix (`artefact-hosting.md`):
   - artefact `private` → only the owner (only their own entry exists anyway);
   - artefact `authenticated` → any signed-in user may load **any** author's entry;
   - artefact `public` → anyone (incl. unauthenticated) may load **any** author's entry.
5. **Write only your own context**: a viewer can write only when the loaded data context is
   their **own** entry. Loading another author's entry is **read-only** — the served artefact
   is in read-only mode and write attempts are rejected.
6. **Inert when archived**: if the artefact is `archived`, the data API returns 404 for both
   reads and writes (consistent with `artefact-hosting.md` invariant 7).
7. **Lifecycle-bound**: entries have no existence independent of their artefact.
8. **Blob bounds**: `blob` is valid JSON and ≤ `MAX_BLOB_BYTES` (5 MB). Contents are opaque
   — the artefact owns the shape; the backend does not interpret it.

## BFF endpoints (shape, to be finalized)

Consumed by **two different clients** — keep them distinct:

- **Host UI** (Artefactor's Svelte chrome around the iframe) drives the data-context
  switcher: list which authors have data, and load a chosen author's blob into the viewer.
- **Served artefact** never calls these directly; its persistence flows through the hijacked
  `localStorage`, which the BFF seeds and writes on its behalf.

| Method | Path | Purpose | Consumer / access |
|--------|------|---------|-------------------|
| `GET` | `/api/artefacts/:slug/data/authors` | List authors who have an entry (id + `updatedAt`) | host UI; per access matrix |
| `GET` | `/api/artefacts/:slug/data/:authorId` | Load one author's blob (for seeding/switching) | host UI; per access matrix |
| `GET` | `/api/artefacts/:slug/data/me` | The caller's own entry | host/runtime; authenticated |
| `PUT` | `/api/artefacts/:slug/data/me` | Upsert the caller's blob (full replace) | runtime (shim write-through); authenticated |
| `PATCH` | `/api/artefacts/:slug/data/me` | Merge a partial blob into the caller's entry (RFC 7396) | programmatic clients (MCP); authenticated |
| `DELETE` | `/api/artefacts/:slug/data/me` | Remove the caller's entry | authenticated |

The author-listing and per-author endpoints exist **only** to power the host switcher; the
artefact itself stays opaque and single-dataset.

### Merge-patch semantics (PATCH `/me`)

`PUT` replaces the whole blob; `PATCH` lets a programmatic caller (the MCP connector) update
**part** of the blob without resending all of it. The request body is a **JSON Merge Patch**
([RFC 7396](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7396)) applied to the caller's current blob
(absent entry = `{}`):

- an object recursively merges key-by-key;
- a member set to `null` **deletes** that key;
- any other value replaces the value at that key.

This is the single place the store looks *inside* the blob, so it is constrained: both the
current blob and the patch must be JSON **objects** (the localStorage keyspace model,
`{ [key]: value }`, always is). A patch against a non-object blob, or a non-JSON body, is
rejected (`InvalidBlob` → 400). All other invariants are unchanged — the merged result must
still be valid JSON within `MAX_BLOB_BYTES` (AD8 → 413), the write is auth'd and to the
caller's own entry only (AD2/AD3), and an archived/not-viewable artefact is 404 (AD6).

## Artefact runtime contract

**Design principle: the artefact only knows about `localStorage`.** Artefacts are written to
persist with the standard `localStorage` API (as the reference artefact does). Artefactor
**hijacks `localStorage`** on serve so that this persistence transparently flows to the
backend store — with **no changes to the artefact's code**. The artefact sees one dataset and
nothing else; there is no cross-user API inside the artefact.

### 1. localStorage hijack (transparent, zero-change)

On serving an artefact, Artefactor injects a bootstrap **before any artefact script runs**
that replaces `window.localStorage` with a backend-backed shim:

- The shim presents the full synchronous `localStorage` API (`getItem`, `setItem`,
  `removeItem`, `clear`, `key`, `length`).
- The artefact's entire localStorage keyspace is modelled as **one JSON object**
  (`{ [key]: stringValue }`) — and *that object is the `DataEntry.blob`*. This is exactly the
  "one JSON object under one key" pattern artefacts already use.
- **Reads are synchronous** because the shim is **seeded server-side**: the BFF looks up the
  viewer's `DataEntry` while serving and inlines it into the bootstrap, so the in-memory map
  is populated before the artefact runs. No client round-trip on first read.
- **Writes are write-through + debounced**: `setItem`/`removeItem`/`clear` update the
  in-memory map synchronously, then schedule a debounced `PUT …/data/me` of the whole blob.
  A flush on `pagehide`/`visibilitychange` (via `navigator.sendBeacon`) avoids losing the
  last edit.
- **Quota maps to the cap**: a write that would push the blob over `MAX_BLOB_BYTES` (5 MB)
  throws `QuotaExceededError`, mirroring native `localStorage` (and 5 MB is itself a typical
  localStorage budget, so artefacts already tolerate it).
- **Read-only contexts throw on write.** When the seeded data is read-only — an
  unauthenticated viewer of a `public` artefact, or a viewer who has loaded *another* user's
  data via the host switcher — writes are no-ops that throw like a full/read-only store.
  Seeded reads still work. The artefact cannot tell why; it just tolerates the failure.

The shim surface is finalized in slice **S13**. No `window.ARTEFACTOR` helper is exposed to
the artefact — persistence is `localStorage` only.

### 2. Data context (host-level, outside the artefact)

Which `DataEntry` is seeded into the artefact is the **data context**, chosen by Artefactor's
host UI, not the artefact:

- Default context = the **viewer's own** entry (read-write).
- A signed-in viewer with read access (per the access matrix) can use a host **user-picker
  widget** to load **another** author's entry. That re-seeds the artefact (e.g. iframe
  reload) with the selected blob in **read-only** mode.
- The artefact is oblivious to all of this: it always just sees "the one dataset" via
  `localStorage`. Switching context is opaque to it.

This keeps cross-user viewing entirely in the host application (BFF + chrome), backed
by the `…/data/authors` and `…/data/:authorId` endpoints above.

**Realized in S12 as a server-rendered shell.** `/a/:slug` returns a thin host shell (a
toolbar with the author picker) that wraps an `<iframe>` loading the artefact from
`/a/:slug/frame` (`?author=<id>` chooses the context). The shell is server-rendered rather
than part of the Svelte SPA because `/a/:slug` is the shareable link and must also serve
unauthenticated/public viewers, who never load the SPA. The picker is access-matrix gated
(AD4) — including anonymous reads of a `public` artefact — so the `…/authors` and
`…/:authorId` endpoints are **not** `requireAuth`-gated. Only the viewer's *own* context is
seeded writable; any other author is read-only (AD5).

## Decided

- **`MAX_BLOB_BYTES` = 5 MB.**
- **Single mutable blob per (artefact, author), upsert** — no append log of submissions.
- **No anonymous writes.** A `public` artefact's data is read-for-all, write-for-signed-in.
  Consequence: public artefacts cannot collect submissions from logged-out visitors.
- **localStorage is hijacked** so artefacts persist to the backend with zero code changes;
  the shim is **seeded server-side** so reads stay synchronous. **No `ARTEFACTOR` helper is
  exposed to the artefact** — it sees one opaque dataset, `localStorage` only.
- **Cross-user viewing is a host feature**, not an artefact capability: a host user-picker
  loads another author's data **read-only** by re-seeding the artefact. The artefact never
  knows whose data it holds.

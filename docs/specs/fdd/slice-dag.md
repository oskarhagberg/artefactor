# FDD — Feature Slice DAG (v0.2)

Each slice is a **vertical cut** through the stack: BFF endpoint (Hono) + domain logic +
Drizzle persistence + Svelte UI where relevant. Built **test-first** (TDD) against the
invariants it touches. A slice is only started once its dependencies are done.

## Slices & acceptance criteria

Acceptance criteria are the seed for each slice's unit tests. Invariant numbers reference
`ddd/artefact-hosting.md` (AH), `ddd/identity-access.md` (IA), and `ddd/artefact-data.md` (AD).

### S0 — Scaffold *(prerequisite, not a domain slice)*
Monolith builds and runs: Hono serves the Svelte app; Drizzle connected to SQLite with
migrations; Tailwind + shadcn-svelte wired; pure `domain/` layer + Vitest harness; Docker
image builds and runs locally. **Full detail: [`s0-scaffold.md`](./s0-scaffold.md).**

### S1 — Identity (BetterAuth)
- Users sign up / sign in with **email + password** (dev phase); **Google OAuth** added
  later as an additive method on the same user.
- An authenticated session exposes a stable `ownerId` to the BFF.
- Protected endpoints reject unauthenticated requests. *(IA 1)*

### S2 — Create artefact
- Authenticated owner creates an artefact from title + kind + HTML upload.
- New artefact is `active` / `private`, `publicSlug = null`. *(AH create)*
- Rejects empty payload, oversize payload, empty title. *(AH 2, 3)*
- `ownerId` = current session user. *(AH 1)*

### S3 — Edit artefact
- Owner updates title / kind / payload; `updatedAt` bumps.
- Same payload/title invariants as create. *(AH 2, 3)*
- Rejected if artefact is archived. *(AH 7)*
- Non-owner cannot edit. *(AH 8)*

### S4 — Owner views own artefact
- Owner can view their own `active` artefact at any visibility.
- Archived gets 404 (reached only via dashboard restore). *(AH 7)*

### S5 — Share / unshare
- Share raises visibility to `authenticated` or `public`; mints a unique slug on first
  share, reuses the retained slug thereafter; tier can be changed between the two. *(AH 4, 5, 6)*
- Unshare sets `private`, retains slug. *(AH 5)*
- Owner-only; blocked while archived. *(AH 7, 9)*

### S6 — Serve artefact by slug (access matrix)
- Serving an `active` artefact by slug enforces the access matrix: `public` → anyone;
  `authenticated` → any signed-in user; `private` → owner only. *(AH 8)*
- Wrong-tier viewer, archived, and unknown slug → 404. *(AH 7, 8)*

### S7 — Archive / restore
- Archive hides + un-serves the artefact and its data, sets `archivedAt`. *(AH 7)*
- Restore returns it to `active` with prior visibility, clears `archivedAt`. Owner-only. *(AH 9)*

### S8 — API key issue / revoke
- Owner issues a key (plaintext shown once) and can revoke it. *(IA 2, 3)*

### S9 — API push ingestion
- A valid API key creates an artefact attributed to the key's Account, satisfying all
  create invariants. *(AH 10, IA 2)*
- A revoked/invalid key is rejected. *(IA 3)*

### S10 — Owner dashboard
- Owner lists their own `active` artefacts (archived hidden by default); shows visibility +
  shareable link when shared, grouped/filterable by kind.

### S11 — Store: read/write own data blob
- Authenticated viewer upserts their own JSON blob for an artefact (one per author). *(AD 1, 2, 3)*
- `GET …/data/me` returns the caller's blob; rejects oversize/invalid JSON. *(AD 8)*
- Unauthenticated write rejected; archived artefact → 404. *(AD 3, 6)*

### S12 — Host UI: data-context switcher
- A signed-in viewer with read access can list authors who have data and load another
  author's blob into the artefact, **read-only** (re-seed/iframe reload). *(AD 4, 5)*
- Tiers enforced via the `…/data/authors` + `…/data/:authorId` endpoints: private → owner
  only; authenticated → signed-in; public → anyone. *(AD 4)*
- This lives entirely in the host (BFF + Svelte chrome); the artefact stays opaque.

### S13 — Artefact runtime bootstrap (localStorage hijack)
- Served artefacts get an injected shim that **replaces `window.localStorage`** with a
  backend-backed store, **seeded server-side** with the current data context so reads are
  synchronous; writes are write-through + debounced with a `pagehide` beacon flush. *(AD runtime contract §1)*
- The artefact needs **zero code changes** and sees **one opaque dataset** — `localStorage`
  only, no `ARTEFACTOR` helper.
- Over-cap write throws `QuotaExceededError`; a read-only context (logged-out public viewer,
  or another author's data loaded via S12) throws on write while seeded reads still work. *(AD 3, 5, 8)*

### S14 — Browse gallery
- A signed-in user browses artefacts shared to them (`authenticated` + `public`), grouped by
  kind; private artefacts of others never appear. *(AH 8)*

## Build order

Topological: **S0 → S1 → S2 → {S3, S4, S5, S7, S10, S11}**, **S5 → {S6, S14}**,
**S11 → {S12, S13}**, **S1 → S8 → S9**. S10 can land early (right after S2) to give a
working surface to iterate against. The data-store branch (S11–S13) is independent of the
sharing branch and can proceed in parallel once S2 exists.
